# docgen

A tool for automatic documentation generation in zepto.

It is basically the material from zeps' `docgen` command
as a standalone library.

## Usage

The idea is to provide automatic documentation generation
from docstrings with a common, extensible format.

Read more about the format and output [here](https://github.com/zeps-system/zeps#documenting-packages)!

## Shoutouts

The syntax highlighting is courtesy of [prism](http://prismjs.com/).

Have fun!
